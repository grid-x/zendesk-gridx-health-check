# Zendesk gridX Health Check

Zendesk gridX Health Check is a Zendesk Support App that allows running predefined tests and plausibility checks against gridBoxes in the field.

![Zendesk gridX Health Check](./doc/app.png)

## Synopsis

gridX provides a suite of health checks for gridBoxes [via API](https://community.developer.gridx.de/t/gridx-api-documentation/213#post-/health-checks). 
We use it internally within our support team to help them diagnose issues and mis-configuration of devices in the field more efficiently.

New checks are made available on a regular basis to cover additional scenarios as they become know.
These checks will be available in Zendesk through this app automatically without having to update this app.

## üìñ Usage

The app takes a gridBox serial number as input and runs [all available checks](https://community.developer.gridx.de/t/gridx-api-documentation/213#get-/health-checks) against it.
It reports the result along with a description of checks and some metadata about failures. If the serial number is available in a custom field, it uses it automatically.

That's it.

## üì¶ Installation

To install the App into your Zendesk instance, proceed as follows.

1. Make sure you have a policy group having the `HealthCheckRequest` permission set up. Copy the group ID from the URL.

## üîß Development

Feel free to fork this repository and change it as you see fit.
If you add improvements you think are beneficial for others, too: 
We can't wait for your pull requests!

### Prerequisites

- [`zcli`](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/getting-started/using-zcli/#installing-and-updating-zcli),  the Zendesk development CLI tool
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 18.12.1
- Access to a Zendesk instance with permissions to install apps

For additional details on building Zendesk Apps, please refer to the [scaffold repository](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffolds/tree/master/packages/react#readme) and the [official documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/getting_started/).

### Running locally

To serve the app to your Zendesk instance with `?zcli_apps=true`, follow the steps below:

- `nvm use` - use the the proper node version for the development environment
- `npm install` - install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - in one terminal, start the dev server
- `npm run start` - in a second terminal, expose the app so it can be displayed in Zendesk

Now open a ticket in Zendesk and append `?zcli_apps=true` to the URL. The app will display as support app now.

> **Note:** Running the `npm run dev` command enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which allows you to see the changes you make to your code immediately without having to manually refresh the page. This greatly enhances the development experience.

### üèóÔ∏è Building

To build an package the app for upload, run the following in the project root.

```sh
zcli apps:bump -m src
npm run build  
RELEASE_VERSION=$(jq -r ".version" src/manifest.json)
zcli apps:package dist
mv dist/tmp/*.zip dist/tmp/zendesk-gridx-health-check_$RELEASE_VERSION.zip
```

This will create a zip file ready to upload as a Zendesk Support App in `dist/tmp`.
